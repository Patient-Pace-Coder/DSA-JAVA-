    here we will be given m number of houses, and n number of paints,
    we have to return the total number of ways we can paint the houses
    in such a way that no two consecutive houses will have same colour.
    This is similar to the previous question of maximum sum non-adjacent elements.

    Approach :
    dp array will be m rows and n columns

    storage and meaning : in each cell we will store the number of ways we can paint that house such that it ends with row th colour
